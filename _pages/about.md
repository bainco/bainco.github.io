Hello world! I'm a Teaching Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Northwestern University. My research lies at the intersection of computer science and the learning sciences and focuses on 1. framing computation as a fundamental literacy of the new world and 2. understanding teacher expertise/practice.

In the CS Department at NU, I teach both at the intro and upper-level but specialize in large course coordination. My **COMP_SCI 111** _Fundamentals of Computer Programming I_ course routinely has 400+ engineering and other STEM major students enrolled while **COMP_SCI 110** _Introduction to Computer Programming_ usually has around 300 students from majors across the university. My upper-level seminar courses tend to focus on CS Pedagogy, communication, and cognitive aspects of computer science education.
