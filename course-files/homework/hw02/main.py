# Your tasks: modify the function bodies of the following 4 function definitions:

def make_oval(canvas, center, radius_x, radius_y, fill_color='hotpink'):
    # Exercise 1: currently, this function creates a hard-coded oval with a top-left
    # coordinate of (100, 100), and a bottom-right coordinate of (200, 150).
    #
    # Your job is to modify the code so that:
    # 1. the top-left (x, y) and bottom-right (x, y) coordinates are
    #    calculated  based on the radius_x, radius_y and center point
    #    specified by the arguments.
    # 2. the fill color is determined based on the color argument.
    canvas.create_oval(
        [

    # Exercise 2: currently, this function creates a hard-coded circle with a top-left
    # coordinate of (300, 100), and a bottom-right coordinate of (400, 200).
    #
    # Your job is  to modify the code so that:
    # 1.  the top-left (x, y) and bottom-right (x, y) coordinates are
    #     calculated based on the radius and center point specified
    #     by arguments.
    # 2.  the fill color is  determined by the color argument.
    #
    # HINT: complete this taks by calling (or "invoking") the
    #       make_oval function that you just made in Exercise 1.
