This course focuses on the exploration, construction and analysis of multi-agent models. Sample models from a variety of content domains are explored and analyzed. Spatial and network topologies are introduced. The prominent agent-based frameworks are covered as well as methodology for replicating, verifying and validating agent-based models. We use state of the art ABM and complexity science tools. This course can help satisfy the project course and artificial intelligence area course requirement for CS and CIS majors, and satisfy the breadth requirement in artificial intelligence for Ph.D. students in CS. It also satisfies a design course requirement for Learning Sciences graduate students, counts towards the Cognitive Science specialization and as an advanced elective for the Cognitive Science major.
